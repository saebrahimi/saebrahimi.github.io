I am an associate professor at ÉTS and an adjunct professor at McGill. Before joining ÉTS, I was a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor [Doina Precup](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup){:target="\_blank"} at [McGill](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca){:target="\_blank"}/[Mila](https://mila.quebec){:target="\_blank"}.
Before my postdoc, I was a researcher at [Microsoft Research Montréal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/){:target="\_blank"}.
<br />
I received my Ph.D. from [Polytechnique Montréal](https://polymtl.ca){:target="\_blank"}/[Mila](https://mila.quebec){:target="\_blank"} in 2016 under the supervision of Professor [Chris Pal](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/){:target="\_blank"}.
During my Ph.D. studies, I worked on computer vision and deep learning applied to emotion recognition, object tracking and knowledge distillation.
<br />
My current research focuses on:
<ul>
<li>reinforcement learning</li>
<li>multi-modal learning</li>
<li>clinical decision support systems</li>
<li>climate modelling and disaster response</li>
</ul>

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [McGill](http://rl.cs.mcgill.ca){:target="\_blank"}/[Mila](https://mila.quebec){:target="\_blank"} working with Professor [Doina Precup](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup){:target="\_blank"}.
My current research interests are multimodal learning, reasoning across modalities, metalearning and in general efficient representation learning.
I also work on deep learning methods for dialogue systems and humanitarian AI.

I was on maternity leave from May 2018 to February 2019.

Before my postdoc, I was a researcher at [Microsoft Research Montreal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-montreal/){:target="\_blank"}.

I received my Ph.D. from [Polytechnique Montreal](https://polymtl.ca){:target="\_blank"}/[Mila](https://mila.quebec){:target="\_blank"} in 2016 under the supervision of Professor [Chris Pal](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/){:target="\_blank"}.
During my Ph.D. studies, I worked on computer vision and deep learning applied to emotion recognition, object tracking and knowledge distillation.

Feel free to reach out, if you're interested in my research and would like to discuss.

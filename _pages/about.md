I am an assistant professor at the University of Calgary, in the Department of Electrical and Software Engineering, Schulich School of Engineering. I am also an adjunct professor at McGill and ÉTS. I hold a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at Mila. Before joining UCalgary, I was an associate professor at ÉTS. Prior to that, I was a postdoctoral fellow working with Professor [Doina Precup](https://cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup){:target="\_blank"} at McGill/Mila.
I have also worked as a researcher at Microsoft Research Montréal.
<br />
I received my Ph.D. from Polytechnique Montréal/Mila in 2016 under the supervision of Professor [Chris Pal](https://mila.quebec/en/person/pal-christopher/){:target="\_blank"}.
During my Ph.D. studies, I worked on computer vision and deep learning applied to emotion recognition, object tracking and knowledge distillation.
<br />
My current research focuses on:
<ul>
<li>deep learning (generalization and interpretability)</li>
<li>reinforcement learning</li>
<li>multi-modal learning</li>
<li>clinical decision support systems</li>
<li>climate modelling and disaster response</li>
</ul>
